# demo nodes are basically nodes present in the demo_node_py with samples as publisher talker.

## the command used for demo nodes is ''' ros2 run demo_node_py talker''' 

### This will display a chain of publisher named "talker" with the time and item value exclusively into your terminal ... another node listener could be used to understand the subscriber aspect of the chain of commands ....

### Now we will move on to the turtlesim , which is a ros2 package used to deal with the robots in 2 dimensions first .... we can check our topics on this turtle sim  we can also control the velocity of this turtle similar to an original robot.
